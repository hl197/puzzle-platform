    Note that this class really represents a puzzle *state*
    and not just a generic type of puzzle. In other words,
    an instance of this class could represent one particular
    Sudoku puzzle, with a partially filled-in board.

    The rules of the game are encoded in the 'is_solved'
    and 'extensions' methods.

    Subclasses are responsible for tracking the internal state
    of the puzzle, and implementing four methods:
        - __str__
        - is_solved
        - extensions
        - move
